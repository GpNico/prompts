This dataset contains the translated triples and templates for TREx and GoogleRE. 
For each language there is a folder containing triples for TREx-relations (`P*.jsonl`) and GoogleRE relations. The templates are stored in `templates.jsonl`. 
The field `lineid` is a triple id within each relation that is consistent across languages.
We include data for all languages, however we performed experiments only on languages that cover 20% of the original English triples, resulting in 53 languages. 
The list of languages is below.
